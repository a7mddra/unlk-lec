# LibreLec 🔓

`LibreLec` is a Python tool designed to extract high-resolution slides from protected university viewers (like PDF.js with DRM wrappers). It "hijacks" the browser canvas to reconstruct the document as a clean, local PDF, enabling you to study using modern tools like Google NotebookLM, iPad annotation apps, or simply offline.

## Features ✨

*   **Canvas Hijack Protocol**: Captures the raw rendered pixels, bypassing disabled download buttons.
*   **Retina Quality**: Uses a 2.5x device scale factor to ensure text remains crisp for OCR and AI processing.
*   **Smart Auto-Discovery**: Detects DRM protection frames automatically.
*   **Manual Login**: You log in securely with your own hands; the bot simply takes over once you're in.
*   **Batch Friendly**: Smart naming (`Lec1`, `Lec2`, etc.) for extracting a whole semester quickly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🐧 Linux / macOS

We have a one-click setup script that handles the virtual environment (`venv`) and dependencies.

1.  **Open your terminal** in the project folder.
2.  **Run the setup script**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup_env.sh
    ./setup_env.sh
    ```
3.  **Launch the tool**:
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

### 🪟 Windows

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```cmd
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2.  **Activate it**:
    ```cmd
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Run the Installer**:
    This script will install all dependencies (including `nest_asyncio`) and the Chromium browser engine.
    ```cmd
